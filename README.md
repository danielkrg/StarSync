# StarSync Dashboard:

A dynamic React project that emplays Spotify's API to display user listening habits and generate custom 'Oracle readings' using a data-driven algorithm.
This application provides smooth transitions between interactive, user-friendly pages and works across a variety of devices. 

## Live Demo:
[starsync.onrender.com](starsync.onrender.com)

## Features:
- OAuth-based Spotify authentication
- 3 part horoscope algorithm driven by data analysis
- Mobile-Friendly design with responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Fallback UI and graceful error handling

## Built With:
- React & Vite for client side
- Express and Node.js for server side
- Tailwind CSS
- Spotify API

## What I Learned:
- Full-Stack software development process 
- Responsive and Dynamic design including scrolling, custom animations, adjustment to window sizes, and more
- Web Application error debugging strategies
- API integration 

## API Limitations:
As of May 15th 2025, Spotify requires legal business licenses and 250k+ monthly active users for extended usage.
Thus the potential userbase for this project is currently limited to 25 users, pre-authorized by an email account.
This project remains functional in the demo mode with code 'HireMe' â€” contact me for full access.
